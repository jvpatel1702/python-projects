Choose a word list: Select a list of words that you will use for the game. You can either create your own list or use an existing one.

Create the game interface: Design a graphical user interface (GUI) using a Python library such as Tkinter. The interface should have an area for displaying the word and another area for displaying the hangman figure.

Implement the game logic: Write the code that will handle the game logic. This should include the ability to select a random word from the list, display the word with underscores representing the letters, and allow the player to input guesses. The game should keep track of incorrect guesses and display the hangman figure accordingly.

Add more features: Once the basic game is working, you can add additional features such as a score system, a timer, or hints to help the player guess the word.

Test the game: Test the game thoroughly to ensure that it works correctly for a wide range of inputs. Make sure that the interface and game logic are working as intended.

Document your code: Write comments in your code to explain how it works and what each section does. This will make it easier for others to understand and modify your code in the future.

Submit your completed project: Once you have completed the Hangman game, submit it to me for review. Make sure to include any necessary files or documentation, and be prepared to explain how your game works and how you approached the project.
